Not much to say here just go to the [AdventOfCode 2019 Website](https://adventofcode.com/2019/) and check out the puzzles. There is a new one each day that you have to solve with programming and get points.

I choose to use [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org). Not because it's my favorite language (I have none), or that it is very difficult or anything challanging in general, but it's a language I want to learn for a long time, and finally found a reason to do so.


## Testing out my code
First run ``cargo update`` to install the dependencies.

After installing the dependencies you can simply run ``cargo run --bin dayXX`` (Replacing XX with a number from 1-25).
You can also just build the binary with ``cargo build --bin dayXX``, the built binary is stored in ``target/debug/dayXX``

The debug binaries are a bit slow sometimes. You can add ``--release`` to build/run the optimized version. If you build a release binary it will be stored in ``target/release/dayXX``.

On systems that support the bash syntax (Linux, MacOS, Linux System for Windows, git bash, ...) you can also run the ``run_all_days.sh`` shell script. The script will build all days (with the release target) and run them.

## Disclaimer
The solutions here are implemented me, they might not be the best solution possible.

If I get stuck on a puzzle I will look in other solutions, but I will still implement them myself after I understood the concept.

After I implemented my version I will also try and optimize it even with inspiration from other solution, but the same rule applies:
I will implement it myself when I can understand, how and why that optimization works, otherwise I won't use it.

I will also mark solutions / optimizations inspired by other ideas.
