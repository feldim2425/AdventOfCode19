# Advent of Code < 2019 >

[![Advent of Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Day-03-blue?style=for-the-badge)](https://adventofcode.com/2019/) [![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-Rust-orange?style=for-the-badge&logo=rust)](https://www.rust-lang.org)

Not much to say here just go to the [AdventOfCode 2019 Website](https://adventofcode.com/2019/) and check out the puzzles. There is a new one each day that you have to solve with programming and get points.

I choose to use [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org). Not because it's my favorite language (I have none), or that it is very difficult or anything challanging in general, but it's a language I want to learn for a long time, and finally found a reason to do so.


## Testing out my code
Just run ``cargo run --bin dayXX`` (Replacing XX with a number from 1-25).

You can also just build the binary with ``cargo build --bin dayXX``
